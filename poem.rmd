The wanderer, blown off course time and again.  
After he plundered Troy’s sacred heights.  

Of all the cities he saw, the minds he grasped,  
The suffering deep in his heart at sea.  
As he struggled to survive and bring his men home.  
But could not save them, hard as he tried—  
The fools—destroyed by their own recklessness.  
When they ate the oxen of Hyperion the Sun,  
And that god snuffed out their day of return.  

Speak, Immortal One,  
And tell the tale once more in our time.  

By now, all the others who had fought at Troy—  
At least those who had survived the war and the sea—  
Were safely back home. Only Odysseus. Still longed to return to his home and his wife.  
The nymph Calypso, a powerful goddess—  
And beautiful—was clinging to him. In her caverns and yearned to possess him.
